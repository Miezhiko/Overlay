# The slot is this ebuild's major version. It is spelt as an unindented literal
# at column 0, not as $(ver_cut 1), because the overlay's autoupdate engine
# scrapes it with a plain text regex anchored at ^SLOT= -- it neither sources the
# ebuild nor reads metadata/md5-cache, so an indented or computed value is
# invisible to it and the per-slot record cannot resolve a current version.
# scripts/check-slot-naming-contract.sh asserts this literal matches the major in
# the filename, which is what a computed value used to guarantee: copy this file
# to a new major and forget to change the line, and that check fails.

# Version-driven bounds, taken from ::gentoo's own 24 series
# (nodejs-24.16.0-r1) rather than from the 26 ebuild: a 26-era floor would
# reject libraries slot 24 builds against perfectly well. This block, SRC_URI
# and PATCHES are the only places the two slots are expected to differ.
#
# What these numbers are NOT is a mirror of what deps/ vendors. They are the
# floors ::gentoo's 24 maintainer settled on -- the oldest API each --shared-*
# link is known to work against. Measured against this tarball, deps/ is ahead
# of several of them, and that is fine:
#
#   dep       floor here  24.18.1 has  26.5.1 has  ::gentoo has
#   ada       3.3.0       3.4.4        3.4.4       3.4.4
#   brotli    1.1.0       1.2.0        1.2.0       1.2.0-r1
#   c-ares    1.34.5      1.34.6       1.34.6      1.34.8
#   libuv     1.52.1      1.52.1       1.52.1      1.52.1
#   simdjson  4.6.1       4.6.4        4.6.4       4.6.2
#   nghttp2   1.69.0      1.69.0       1.69.0      1.69.0
#   nghttp3   1.14.0      1.14.0       1.17.0      1.18.0
#   ngtcp2    1.14.0      1.15.1       1.23.0      1.25.0
#   openssl   3.5.6       3.5.7        3.5.7       3.6.3
#
# Left alone deliberately, and the simdjson row is why: "raise every floor to
# whatever deps/ vendors" is the obvious-looking rule and it is wrong. deps/
# vendors simdjson 4.6.4 while ::gentoo ships at most 4.6.2, so that rule
# makes the package uninstallable. A floor is a claim about an API, and
# raising one without a build behind it buys a user-visible restriction with
# no evidence. Move a line here when a build actually fails below it.
#
# Two rows are real 24-vs-26 differences rather than staleness -- nghttp3 and
# ngtcp2. 24.18.1 vendors 1.14.0 and 1.15.1 where 26.5.1 vendors 1.17.0 and
# 1.23.0, so the 26 ebuild's higher floors would simply be wrong here. ada and
# brotli, by contrast, have CONVERGED since ::gentoo's 24.16.0-r1 snapshot:
# both majors now vendor 3.4.4 and 1.2.0. Their floors differ only because
# ::gentoo's 24 ebuild predates that, not because the series disagree.
#
# dev-cpp/simdutf is DELIBERATELY ABSENT, matching this overlay's 26 ebuild
# and diverging from ::gentoo, which carries >=dev-cpp/simdutf-7.3.4:= plus
# --shared-simdutf on BOTH its 24.16.0-r1 and its 26.3.0. That is the whole
# point: it is a bentoo decision about the package, not a difference between
# majors, so re-adding it here alone would split the two slots on a choice
# that is not allowed to differ between them.
#
# It also stands on its own merits. --shared-simdutf does not REPLACE the
# bundled copy, it adds a second one. Node 24.18.1 ships no top-level
# deps/simdutf; the only copy is deps/v8/third_party/simdutf, v6.4.0.
# node_shared_simdutf gates exactly two places -- node.gypi:237 (node's own
# target) and node.gyp:1525 (the host js2c tool) -- while
# tools/v8_gypfiles/v8.gyp:1079 makes v8_base_without_compiler depend on that
# vendored simdutf UNCONDITIONALLY. So with the flag on, node's src/*.cc
# compiles against the system headers (dev-cpp/simdutf is 9.0.0 here) while
# V8 compiles against 6.4.0, and both land in one binary. Neither side uses a
# versioned namespace -- both spell it plain `simdutf::`, 435 such symbols in
# libsimdutf.so.34 -- so that is an ODR violation, not a tidy substitution.
#
# Weighed against Gentoo's prefer-system-libraries policy, which genuinely
# points the other way. If that wins, the change belongs on BOTH slots and
# needs a real build on each: --shared-simdutf has never been exercised in
# this overlay, whereas the fallback has (slot 26, commit ecb7586e).

# app-eselect/eselect-nodejs is a *runtime* dependency, not a build one: no
# src_* phase touches it, but pkg_postinst and pkg_postrm run `eselect nodejs`.
# It owns every unversioned path -- /usr/bin/{node,npm,npx}, /usr/include/node,
# the shared bash-completion file, /usr/share/man/man1/node.1 -- plus /etc/npm
# and /etc/env.d/50npm, which this ebuild used to install itself. Without it a
# merged slot is reachable only as node26, never as plain `node`.
#
# The blocker is STRONG (!!) and it is the whole of R4.1/R4.4. net-libs/nodejs:0
# is the pre-slotting package: it installs those same unversioned paths
# directly, so it and app-eselect/eselect-nodejs cannot coexist even for a
# moment -- with FEATURES="protect-owned" the merge aborts on the first shared
# path. A weak (!) blocker permits exactly that momentary coexistence, which is
# why it is not enough here; !! makes portage unmerge the old package first and
# surfaces the conflict during dependency resolution, before any file is
# written.
#
# ":0" is a slot dependency, not a version range, so it needs no maintenance as
# majors go by: it matches the unslotted package (SLOT="0", recorded as "0/26"
# with its sub-slot) and matches no slotted one (SLOT="26"). Caveat for whoever
# adds a live ebuild: the ${PV} == *9999 branch above still sets SLOT="0", and a
# !! blocker is *not* ignored against a package in the parent's own slot
# (depgraph.py checks `not blocker.atom.blocker.overlap.forbid`, false for !!),
# so that branch would need its own SLOT before this atom is correct for it.

# The 26 ebuild has no global PATCHES at all; this one does, and that is
# expected -- a patch exists because a particular major's source needs it, so
# PATCHES is one of the three places (with SRC_URI and the dependency bounds
# above) where two slots of the same recipe legitimately differ.
#
# The 32-bit patch is V8 upstream commit ddfa1b3d ("[turboshaft] Rename TupleOp
# to MakeTupleOp to avoid name conflicts"), backported for
# https://bugs.gentoo.org/969806, where the unrenamed TupleOp collides on
# 32-bit targets -- ~arm and ~x86 here. Carried verbatim from ::gentoo, byte for
# byte, so a future sync can diff it. Verified still NEEDED at 24.18.1, not
# merely still applying: a dry run takes all 50 hunks forward (with offsets),
# whereas a patch already merged upstream comes back reversed.
#
# DELIBERATELY ABSENT -- do not reintroduce ::gentoo 24.16.0-r1's second entry:
#   SRC_URI += https://deps.gentoo.zip/net-libs/nodejs/${P}-nghttp2-1.69.0.patch
#   PATCHES += "${DISTDIR}"/${P}-nghttp2-1.69.0.patch
# It backported upstream's own adaptation to the nghttp2 1.69.0 API into a
# 24.16.0 that still vendored 1.67.x. At 24.18.1 upstream has done that itself:
# deps/nghttp2/lib/includes/nghttp2/nghttp2ver.h reads NGHTTP2_VERSION "1.69.0",
# so the tree already speaks the API that >=net-libs/nghttp2-1.69.0:= provides.
# The patch is also version-stamped and simply does not exist for this release
# -- deps.gentoo.zip serves it for 24.16.0 only (24.17.0, 24.18.0 and 24.18.1
# all return 404), so carrying the entry forward would break fetching outright.

#   something active -> never change it. Speak up only when the selection can

#
# Why not simply "always activate the newest": all 72 references to this

# /usr/bin/node, the link app-eselect/eselect-nodejs owns. Switching silently
# would break someone who pinned an older major on purpose; saying nothing
# would let www-client/chromium's >=net-libs/nodejs-${NODE_VER} fail with
# nothing pointing at the active slot as the cause. The elog is the
# compromise: the user is told and decides.
#
# No --root=: eselect derives its EROOT from the ROOT and EPREFIX that portage
# already exports into pkg_* phases (/usr/bin/eselect, "EROOT=${ROOT%...}..."
# near the top), so these calls are ROOT-scoped without the flag. Passing
# --root= would additionally set ROOT as a variable *inside* eselect that is

# the links and /etc/env.d/50nodejs away.
#
# Correct on a re-emerge too, which is worth spelling out because this phase
# runs then as well -- portage unmerges the OLD instance from inside the new
# one's merge. Verified in portage 3.0's dbapi/vartree.py: _merge_contents()
# (line ~5126) puts the new files on disk BEFORE the old instance is unmerged
# (~5201), and that unmerge is handed `others_in_slot`, so _unmerge_pkgfiles()
# skips every path the new instance owns (isowner(), ~2902). Nothing under
# /usr/lib*/node-${SLOT} disappears, nothing dangles, and cleanup returns
# without touching the selection -- one "No dangling Node.js links found."

# not install, and this is what repairs it.
#
# Its output is deliberately NOT suppressed -- eselect's --brief would hide
# exactly the "No dangling Node.js links found." line while keeping the
# ones that report a change. An unmerge that silently rearranges /usr/bin/node
# is the failure mode this design exists to avoid, so the healthy case saying
# so out loud is what tells "checked, fine" apart from "never ran".

# more: app-eselect/eselect-nodejs is an RDEPEND, so a depclean is free to
# unmerge it before this package. `eselect nodejs cleanup` then exits non-zero
# because the module is gone, and as the last command of this phase that would
