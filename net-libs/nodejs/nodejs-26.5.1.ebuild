# The slot is this ebuild's major version. It is spelt as an unindented literal

# scrapes it with a plain text regex anchored at ^SLOT= -- it neither sources the
# ebuild nor reads metadata/md5-cache, so an indented or computed value is
# invisible to it and the per-slot record cannot resolve a current version.
# scripts/check-slot-naming-contract.sh asserts this literal matches the major in

# app-eselect/eselect-nodejs is a *runtime* dependency, not a build one: no
# src_* phase touches it, but pkg_postinst and pkg_postrm run `eselect nodejs`.
# It owns every unversioned path -- /usr/bin/{node,npm,npx}, /usr/include/node,
# the shared bash-completion file, /usr/share/man/man1/node.1 -- plus /etc/npm
# and /etc/env.d/50npm, which this ebuild used to install itself. Without it a
# merged slot is reachable only as node26, never as plain `node`.
#
# The blocker is STRONG (!!) and it is the whole of R4.1/R4.4. net-libs/nodejs:0
# is the pre-slotting package: it installs those same unversioned paths
# directly, so it and app-eselect/eselect-nodejs cannot coexist even for a
# moment -- with FEATURES="protect-owned" the merge aborts on the first shared
# path. A weak (!) blocker permits exactly that momentary coexistence, which is
# why it is not enough here; !! makes portage unmerge the old package first and
# surfaces the conflict during dependency resolution, before any file is
# written.
#
# ":0" is a slot dependency, not a version range, so it needs no maintenance as
# majors go by: it matches the unslotted package (SLOT="0", recorded as "0/26"
# with its sub-slot) and matches no slotted one (SLOT="26"). Caveat for whoever
# adds a live ebuild: the ${PV} == *9999 branch above still sets SLOT="0", and a
# !! blocker is *not* ignored against a package in the parent's own slot
# (depgraph.py checks `not blocker.atom.blocker.overlap.forbid`, false for !!),
# so that branch would need its own SLOT before this atom is correct for it.

# The default-slot policy (R3.5, R3.6), in two rules:
#
#   nothing active  -> activate this slot. A merged runtime with no
#                      /usr/bin/node is broken for every consumer.
#   something active -> never change it. Speak up only when the selection can
#                      actually break a build.
#
# Why not simply "always activate the newest": all 72 references to this
# package across ::gentoo and this overlay are UNSLOTTED atoms
# (net-libs/nodejs, >=net-libs/nodejs-N), so every one of them resolves through
# /usr/bin/node, the link app-eselect/eselect-nodejs owns. Switching silently
# would break someone who pinned an older major on purpose; saying nothing
# would let www-client/chromium's >=net-libs/nodejs-${NODE_VER} fail with
# nothing pointing at the active slot as the cause. The elog is the
# compromise: the user is told and decides.
#
# No --root=: eselect derives its EROOT from the ROOT and EPREFIX that portage
# already exports into pkg_* phases (/usr/bin/eselect, "EROOT=${ROOT%...}..."
# near the top), so these calls are ROOT-scoped without the flag. Passing
# --root= would additionally set ROOT as a variable *inside* eselect that is
# never exported, which the `env update` do_set ends with would not see --
# app-editors/emacs passes it, but its module has no such tail call.

# R3.4's repair path. `cleanup` is not merely "remove what dangles": once it
# finds any dead managed link it drops the whole managed set, then re-points it
# at the highest slot still installed -- or, when this was the last slot, takes
# the links and /etc/env.d/50nodejs away.
#
# Correct on a re-emerge too, which is worth spelling out because this phase
# runs then as well -- portage unmerges the OLD instance from inside the new
# one's merge. Verified in portage 3.0's dbapi/vartree.py: _merge_contents()
# (line ~5126) puts the new files on disk BEFORE the old instance is unmerged
# (~5201), and that unmerge is handed `others_in_slot`, so _unmerge_pkgfiles()
# skips every path the new instance owns (isowner(), ~2902). Nothing under
# /usr/lib*/node-${SLOT} disappears, nothing dangles, and cleanup returns
# without touching the selection -- one "No dangling Node.js links found."
# line.
#
# So the call is unconditional rather than gated on ${REPLACED_BY_VERSION},
# which would skip the one same-slot case that does need it: a rebuild that
# drops USE=npm leaves /usr/bin/npm pointing at a file the new instance does
# not install, and this is what repairs it.
#
# Its output is deliberately NOT suppressed -- eselect's --brief would hide
# exactly the "No dangling Node.js links found." line while keeping the
# ones that report a change. An unmerge that silently rearranges /usr/bin/node
# is the failure mode this design exists to avoid, so the healthy case saying
# so out loud is what tells "checked, fine" apart from "never ran".
#
# Status-checked and warned, never `die`d, for pkg_postinst's reason plus one
# more: app-eselect/eselect-nodejs is an RDEPEND, so a depclean is free to
# unmerge it before this package. `eselect nodejs cleanup` then exits non-zero
# because the module is gone, and as the last command of this phase that would
# fail the unmerge of an already-unmerged package. dev-lang/php's pkg_postrm
# carries the same caveat as a comment, without the check.
